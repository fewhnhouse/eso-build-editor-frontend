        ESO Build Editor is neither directly nor indirectly related to Bethesda
        Softworks, Zenimax Online Studios or Zenimax Media in any way, shape or
        form, and neither does the application or its owners claim any
        representative rights to them. The Application is entirely non-profit,
        maintained by the Application Owners, and it has no monetary value, nor
        does it gain any profit from any form of advertising or other secondary
        methods. The purpose of the Application is to provide up-to-date
        information on some parts of The Elder Scrolls Online and a way to the
        regular players of the game to manage game-related information (Builds
        and Raids). The Application is not intended to infringe upon the
        copyrights of Bethesda Softworks or its parent and affiliate companies,
        and is neither supported nor endorsed by Bethesda Softworks or its
        licensers.
      </p>
      <p>
        All information in the Application is provided as is, without warranty
        of any kind. Application Owners do not guarantee or take any
        responsibility for the validity of the information provided. In no event
        will the Application Owners be liable to any party for any direct,
        indirect, privileged or consequential damages occurring as a result of
        the use of the Application or its contents. Neither shall the
        Application Owners be liable for damages such as loss of profit,

      </p>
      <p>
        Sets, skills, icons and other in-game information are copyrighted by
        ZeniMax Online Studios. APPLICATION USAGE The purpose of the Application
        is to allow a way to browse skills, sets and other provided game
        information browse, create, edit and share public builds & raids created
        by registered users. As a non-registered user, you can browse skills,
        sets, buff and mundus information browse builds and raids that have been
        set to public. As a registered user, in addition to the above, when
        logged in you can create, save, edit and share builds & raids created by

        referred to as “extended use of the application”.
      </p>
      <b id='lor'>LIMITS OF RESPONSIBILITY </b>
      <p>
        Specific to the Application is the idea that raids and builds can be
        saved as private, and are only shared and viewable to the users the
        creator has given access rights to. Raid and build information and
        access rights are maintained in the register but the Application Owners
        take no responsibility if any private build or raid information is
        shared outside the Application by users who have initially been given
        access to the information. Application Owners can access and handle all
        the information saved in the register, including private raid and build
        information, for maintenance purposes (such as fixing bugs or recovering
        data).
      </p>
      <b id='rapp'>REGISTERING AND PRIVACY POLICY</b>
      <p>
        Registering for the extended use of the Application is done by providing
        a valid email address that is verified by an automated message sent to
        the user, and a valid password. You are responsible for providing a
        secure password and storing your login credentials in a secure way.
        Registering an account also requires you to agree to the Terms and
        Conditions (including the register and data privacy policies).
      </p>
      <b id='iutos'>IMPROPER USE AND TERMINATION OF SERVICE</b>
      <p>
        Application Owners reserve the right to terminate services from users on
        their own consideration, without notice. This includes restricting
        access to the Application and deletion of user’s saved content and
        access to any content within the Application. The Application Owners are
        not required to provide you with any specific information concerning
        possible terminations of services, nor are they required to provide any
        kind of data from the Application after the termination of service.
        Causes for these actions include but are not limited to any kind of
        harmful or improper usage of service, such as abusing a bug, or
        attempting to interfere with the proper functionality or usage of the
        Application. Users are encouraged to report any bugs or improper
        activity in the Application to the Application Owners.
      </p>
      <h3 id='radpp'>Registry and data privacy policies</h3>
      <p>
        This is the GDPR compliant registry and data privacy policy for ESO
        Build Editor (Application).
      </p>
      <b>1. Register holder and application administrators</b>
      <p>@RealPhoenix, @tietokonna some.email@here.com</p>
      <b>3. Name of the register </b>
      <p>User register for Application</p>
      <b>
        4. Legal basis and the purpose of collecting and handling the user
        information
      </b>
      <p>
        The GDPR compliant legal basis for handling the user information is the
        documented, voluntarily, individualised, conscious and unequivocal
        consent of the user. The purpose of collecting and handling the user
        information is enabling the extended usage of the Application and
        providing the user with an account and access rights to the restricted
        information within the Application. Basic usage of the Application does
        not require registration. Collected information is not used for
        automated decision making, profiling or marketing.
      </p>
      <b>5. Contents of the register</b>
      <p>
        Information saved in the register consists of the email of the
        registered user password for registered user saved builds and raids and
        access rights to builds and raids of the user. The information saved in
        the register forms an Account for the Application. The Account will be
        held in the register until the user deletes the account or requests the
        deletion of their account.
      </p>
      <b>6. Regular sources of information </b>
      <p>
        User information saved in the register is gathered only when a user
        registers to use the Application. User will provide the information to
        access the extended features of the Application. Build and raid
        information for user is saved when user creates a build or a raid and
        saves it user is granted access rights to an existing build or a raid,
        and these rights are saved.
      </p>
      <b>
        7. Regular extraditions and transfers of information outside the EU and
        ETA areas
      </b>
      <p>
        Information is not regularly extradited or transferred outside the EU
        and ETA areas, if not specifically agreed with the user.
      </p>
      <b>8. Register protection principles</b>
      <p>
        When handling the register, specific care and caution will be taken and
        information handled by information systems will be appropriately
        protected. Digital safety of the register is properly ensured by
        encryption and other suitable means. The physical safety of servers
        where the register is being held is ensured by the server provider
        (Contabo). The register and the information in it is only handled and
        processed by people with proper permissions and who are required to
        access it for management purposes, such as ensuring the proper
        functionality of the Application.
      </p>
      <b>9. Right for data and correction of information</b>
      <p>
        User’s information saved in the register is available to the user for
        review and correction in the user’s account when logged in to the
        Application. No other information is being collected and user has
        complete control over their information, so no further requests for data
        from the register are necessary.
      </p>
      <b>10. Other personal information related rights</b>
      <p>
        As per the right to be forgotten, the user can remove their user account
        from the register by logging in and performing a deleting procedure
        themselves. Since the extended features of the Application are not
        available to unregistered users, the removal of the user’s information
        will result into restricting access, so no further requests for
        restricting the usage of the data are necessary. The deletion of the
        user’s information is immediate and permanent when performed within the
        Application, and no user information will be stored afterwards.
